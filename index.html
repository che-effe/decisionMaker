Citizens, take control. Take control of your city!

You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.

I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.

Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.
